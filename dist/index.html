                Your objective is to kill as many enemies as you can and don't die yourself. 
                Destroy your enemies and their bridges to save your allies! Glory to the victorious!<br><br>
                Rules:<br>
                - Use your bullets to destroy enemies. Don't let them fly into you or shoot at you,<br>
                - The further you go, the more enemies appear who are more difficult to overcome,<br>
                - Fly over a Fuel to refill your tank. You can also destroy it if you want more points,<br>
                - Passing a bridge is a checkpoint,<br>
                - Every 10.000 points you get an extra life,<br>
                - Your highscore is saved in localstorage when you loose the game.
