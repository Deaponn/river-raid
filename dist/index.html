                How to play:<br>
                Use your bullets to destroy enemies. Don't let them fly into you or shoot at you.<br>
                The further you go, the more enemies appear who are more difficult to overcome.<br>
                Fly over a Fuel to refill your plane's fuel. You can also destroy it if you want to get more points.<br>
                Bridges are checkpoints.<br>
                Every 10.000 points you get an extra life.<br>
                Your highscore saves when you lose the game.<br>
                A page refresh (F5) might be necessary after you had lost the entire game and fancy a new one.
